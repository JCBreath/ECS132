#density
ducd <-function(x,c) {( 3/(2*(c^1.5-1)) ) *x^0.5};
The density function is just based on the fx(x) function. Thus, we just used the original function.

#cdf
pucd <- function(q,c) {(q^1.5 /(c^1.5-1))-1/(c^1.5-1)};
CDF = F(x), which is the integral of density function, and the interval is said to b from 1 to c; Thus, we wrote the function in subtraction in form of c and 1.

#quantile function
qucd <- function(q,c) {((c^1.5-1)*q+1)^{2/3}};
Since Q = F^-1, the quantile function is the inverse of CDF. And this function is the inverse of the function given in cdf.

#random number generator
rucd <- function(n,c) {
	tmp <- runif(n);
	qucd(tmp,c);
};
In rucd, we want to generate n random values. So, we use runif to generate n random values and use qucd to convert it into a value of quantile.
