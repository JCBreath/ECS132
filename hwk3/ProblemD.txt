$$E(U) = \sum_{c=1}^{\infty} P(V=c)E(U|V=c)$$
We can use the coin sample in p72. 
Let H represent V=1 and T represent the V=0. Then P(V=1) = P(H) = p and P(V=0) = p(T) = 1-p
Then$$  E(U) = E(U|H)P(H) + E(U|T)P(T)$$ 
$$E(U) = pE(U|H] + (1-p)E(U|T) $$
$$E(U) =  p + (1-p)(E(U)+1) $$
Hereï¼Œ E(U given T) = EU+1 because there is always one more independent tosse after the turn that toss a tail.
$$E(U) =  p + E(U) - pE(U) + 1 - p$$
$$ 0 =   -pE(U) + 1 $$
$$ E(U) = 1/p $$
