1. long run average number of rolls between wins
  call the number of rolls between wins M. We are to find E(M);
  let Avg(R) denotes the average of all the rolls we got between one win and another;
  E(M) = E(8/Avg(R))=E(8) / E(Avg(R))
  the expected value of Avg(R) is just ER, which is 3.5 according to textbook;
  so E(M) = E(8) / ER = 8/3.5 = 2.2857
  
2. long run value of total winnings per turn. 
  
  
3. ETj:
  if we start at square j, we need to get a total number of (8-j) to win;
  so if we
