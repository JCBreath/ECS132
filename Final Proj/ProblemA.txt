PartA
We first need to read the data from each of the class within each of the quarter. 
So, we use read.table() and get the data by putting the related url link in it. 
For example, E132_W17 <- read.table('http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/132/Hwk/ProblemAData/132/W17.txt'). 
Then, we concatenate each quarters of a class 132, 145, 158 together and form a complete table.

The first problem in Part A asks us to find the 95 confidence interval, we we first find the 
mean value, standard deviation std, total number n of each class's score, and calculate the 95% 
confidence interval by ( mean - std / sqrt(n) , mean + std / sqrt(n) ). This part is done by CI_95 function in our program.

For the second question, we are asked to find the 95 condidence interval for both ecs 132 and 145, 
which means we need to find the confidence interval for 2 independent samples. Let sample of 132 
denote A and sample of 145 denote B. Then, the 95 confidence interval is 
(mean_A - mean_B + 1.96* sqrt(std_A^2/n_A + std_B^2/n_B), mean_A - mean_B - 1.96* sqrt(std_A^2/n_A + std_B^2/n_B)). 
This part is done by CI_DIFF function in our program.

The third question is similar to the second problem. We just need to extract 2 set of data that based on 
ECS145' data's first column of information, "LCSI" and "ECSE", and get 2 separate file by usuing the subset.
Then, we use the CI_DIFF function in our program, and process the data as 2 separate sample, and get the 
95 confidence interval in the similar way as the second problem.

The fourth question, we need to first form 3 vectors, year, course, and major. For year, 
we defind by the format "year.quarter". So, for example, winter 2017 is labeled as 2017.00, 
spring 2016 is labeled as 2016.25, and fall 2015 is labeled as 2015.75. For course, 
we label 0 for ECS132, 1 for ECS145, and 2 for ECS158. For major, we label ECSE as 0 and 
LCSI as 1. Then, we match these label with the dataset we have. The, we combine score, course, 
year, and major into big chunk of data. So, here, we provide a plot that show the relationship 
between each group of data. 
Then, we train the linear regression with function lm(Score ~ Course + Year + Major, data = dat).

For the last question of A, we tried to build a model based on the proportion of CS major and the year; 
then we plot it to get a sense of how well it fits; We come to the conclusion that the model doesn't fit 
the datas well. A Normal Q-Q graph would be nearly linear in ideal cases, but the points are all over the places
and far from the dotted line, which means our model doesn't pass the test of Normality; for the scale-location 
graph, ideally we should have a horizontal line, but instead we result in a irregular sparse graph with our model, 
which means it doesn't pass its test either; finally, for residuals vs leverage graph, although dots are all
lied within the region formed by cook's distance, they are pretty close to the borders.
